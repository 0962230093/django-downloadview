DownloadMixin

The :py:class:`django_downloadview.views.DownloadMixin` class is not a view. It
is a base class which you can inherit of to create custom download views.

``DownloadMixin`` is a base of `BaseDownloadView`_, which itself is a base of
all other django_downloadview's builtin views.

BaseDownloadView
****************

The :py:class:`django_downloadview.views.BaseDownloadView` class is a base
class to create download views. It inherits `DownloadMixin`_ and
:py:class:`django.views.generic.base.View`.

The only thing it does is to implement
:py:meth:`get <django_downloadview.views.BaseDownloadView.get>`: it triggers
:py:meth:`DownloadMixin's render_to_response
<django_downloadview.views.DownloadMixin.render_to_response>`.
