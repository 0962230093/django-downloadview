.. py:module:: django_downloadview.views.http

:class:`HTTPDownloadView` **serves a file given an URL.**, i.e. it acts like
a proxy.

This view is particularly handy when:

* the client does not have access to the file resource, while your Django
  server does.

* the client does trust your server, your server trusts a third-party, you do
  not want to bother the client with the third-party.


**************
Simple example
**************

Setup a view to stream files given URL:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/http/views.py
   :language: python
