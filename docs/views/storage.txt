.. py:module:: django_downloadview.views.storage

:class:`StorageDownloadView` **serves files given a storage and a path**.

Use this view when you manage files in a storage (which is a good practice),
unrelated to a model.


**************
Simple example
**************

Given a storage:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/storage/views.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1, 4-6

Setup a view to stream files in storage:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/storage/views.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 3-5, 10

The view accepts a ``path`` argument you can setup either in ``as_view`` or
via URLconfs:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/storage/urls.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-7, 8-10, 14


**************************
Computing path dynamically
**************************

Override the :meth:`StorageDownloadView.get_path` method to adapt path
resolution to your needs.

As an example, here is the same view as above, but the path is converted to
uppercase:

.. literalinclude:: /../demo/demoproject/storage/views.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 3-5, 13-20
