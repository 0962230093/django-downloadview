*************************
Django's static file view
*************************

`Django has a builtin static file view`_. It can stream files. As explained in
Django documentation, it is designed for development purposes. For production,
static files'd better be served by some optimized server.

Django-downloadview can replace Django's builtin static file view:

* perform actions with Django when receiving download requests: check
  permissions, generate files, gzip, logging, signals...
* delegate actual download to a reverse proxy for increased performance.
* disable optimization middlewares or decorators in development, if you want to
  serve files with Django.
